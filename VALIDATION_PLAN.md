## Days 4-5: Technical Feasibility Validation

### Objective
Prove that VoxCard's core technical assumptions work on Stacks blockchain within hackathon/MVP timeframe.

### The Mandatory 4-Hour Feasibility Test

**Test Goal:** Deploy working smart contract to testnet and interact with it from frontend.

**Success Criteria:**
"If I can deploy a basic savings plan contract to Stacks testnet and make a contribution from the React app, then VoxCard is technically feasible."

### Technical Validation Checklist

#### Smart Contract Validation
- [ ] **Compile contract:** `clarinet wasm` succeeds
- [ ] **Optimize WASM:** Docker optimization runs successfully
- [ ] **Deploy to testnet:** Upload contract to Stacks testnet
- [ ] **Instantiate contract:** Create contract instance with admin
- [ ] **Test CreatePlan:** Successfully create a savings plan
- [ ] **Test JoinPlan:** Successfully join an existing plan
- [ ] **Test Contribute:** Make contribution with actual STX tokens
- [ ] **Test Query:** Retrieve plan details from contract
- [ ] **Test Payout:** Verify auto-payout triggers when balance sufficient

#### Frontend Integration Validation
- [ ] **@stacks/connect wallet connects:** User can connect STX wallet
- [ ] **Create plan from UI:** Form submission deploys contract
- [ ] **View plan details:** Query and display contract state
- [ ] **Make contribution:** Send transaction from UI
- [ ] **View transaction history:** Track on-chain activities
- [ ] **Error handling:** Graceful failures for invalid inputs

#### STX-Specific Features
- [ ] **Gasless transactions:** Test treasury service integration (if implemented)
- [ ] **Account abstraction:** Verify STX account features work
- [ ] **Transaction speed:** Measure confirmation times
- [ ] **Cost analysis:** Calculate average gas costs per transaction

### Feasibility Issues & Pivots

**If 4-hour test fails, consider:**

1. **Simplification Options:**
   - Remove trust score system (add later)
   - Remove partial payments (add later)
   - Remove join approval mechanism (auto-join)
   - Use simpler payout logic (manual trigger vs auto)

2. **Alternative Technical Approaches:**
   - Use different Cosmos chain if STX issues
   - Implement without gasless features initially
   - Use off-chain metadata storage (backend API)
   - Simplify cycle calculation logic

3. **Scope Reduction:**
   - MVP: Single plan type (monthly, fixed participants)
   - Remove trust scores entirely
   - Remove flexible payment options
   - Focus on core ROSCA mechanics only

### AI-Assisted Technical Validation

**Use Context7 + Solana/Cosmos tools for technical questions:**

Since you mentioned using Context7, let's use it for Clarity documentation:

```
Context7 Query: "Clarity contract deployment and instantiation best practices"
Context7 Query: "Stacks blockchain gasless transaction implementation"
Context7 Query: "Clarity state management for iterative cycles"
```

**Ask AI for technical pivots if needed:**
```
AI Prompt: "My Clarity contract deployment is failing with [error]. The goal is to create rotating savings circles on Stacks blockchain. What are 3 simpler approaches to achieve this in a hackathon timeframe?"
```

### Success Criteria - Days 4-5
- [ ] Smart contract successfully deployed to testnet
- [ ] Core functions (create, join, contribute, query) working
- [ ] Frontend can interact with deployed contract
- [ ] Test transaction completed successfully
- [ ] Identified any blocking technical issues
- [ ] Documented technical approach and constraints

## Appendix: Additional Prompts & Templates

### AI Prompt: Challenge My Assumptions
```
I want to build VoxCard, a blockchain-based ROSCA platform, to solve trust and coordination issues in community savings circles. 

I'm definitely making incorrect assumptions and missing critical information. What assumptions am I making that are most likely to kill this project? Focus on dangerous ones that could cause failure. Keep digging until you find the big one.

Here's what I believe:
1. Traditional ROSCAs have widespread fraud problems
2. People in target markets will adopt crypto wallets for savings
3. Smart contracts provide enough value to justify complexity
4. Users will trust code over human coordinators
5. [Add more assumptions]

Challenge each assumption and help me identify blind spots.
```

### AI Prompt: Expert Interview Simulation
```
Roleplay as a fintech expert who has worked on savings platforms in Nigeria for 10 years. I'm validating VoxCard, a blockchain-based ROSCA platform. 

As this expert:
1. What questions would you ask me?
2. What concerns would you have about the approach?
3. What would I need to prove to convince you this is worth pursuing?
4. What am I likely missing about the market?

Be brutally honest and skeptical.
```

### AI Prompt: Market Sizing Reality Check
```
Help me realistically estimate the market size for VoxCard, a blockchain ROSCA platform targeting Nigeria and Kenya. 

Break down:
- TAM (Total Addressable Market)
- SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)  
- SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market - Year 1)

Be conservative in your estimates and explain your reasoning. Point out where I might be overestimating.
