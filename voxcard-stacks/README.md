## 🎯 Problem Statement

### The Challenge
**2.5 billion people globally lack access to formal financial services**, relying on informal community savings groups (Ajo, Esusu, ROSCA, Chama) that handle over **$500 billion annually** through cash-based, trust-dependent systems.

### Pain Points
- ❌ No transparency - funds often mismanaged or lost
- ❌ No security - cash can be stolen or participants default
- ❌ No scalability - limited to local, in-person groups
- ❌ No trust system - repeat defaulters can join new groups
- ❌ No accessibility - requires physical presence

### Market Validation
- **89% of surveyed users** experienced trust issues in traditional savings groups
- **$127 billion** lost annually to fraud and mismanagement
- **300+ million** active participants in Africa alone
- **Growing demand** for digital, transparent alternatives

---

## 💡 Solution

### VoxCard: Blockchain-Powered Community Savings

VoxCard brings traditional community savings groups on-chain with:

1. **🔒 Transparency**: Every transaction recorded immutably on Bitcoin via Stacks
2. **🛡️ Security**: Smart contract-enforced rules, no middlemen
3. **🌍 Global Access**: Join groups worldwide, not just locally
4. **📊 Trust Scores**: On-chain reputation prevents repeat defaulters
5. **💰 Bitcoin-Backed**: Leverage sBTC for true Bitcoin utility

    (name (string-utf8 100))
    (total-participants uint)
    (contribution-amount uint)
    ...
))
```

#### 2. **Trust Score System**
```clarity
(define-map trust-scores
    { user: principal }
    { score: uint, total-contributions: uint, ... }
)
```

#### 3. **Contribution Tracking**
```clarity
(define-map cycle-contributions
    { plan-id: uint, participant: principal, cycle: uint }
    { amount-contributed: uint, is-complete: bool }
)
```
