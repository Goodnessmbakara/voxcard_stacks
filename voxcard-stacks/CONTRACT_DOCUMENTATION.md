# VoxCard Savings Smart Contract Documentation

## Overview

VoxCard Savings is a production-grade Clarity smart contract implementing decentralized community savings groups (Ajo/Esusu) on the Stacks blockchain with native Bitcoin integration.

## Contract Features

### ✅ Technical Excellence
- **Type-Safe**: Uses Clarity's strong type system for guaranteed security
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient data structures with minimal storage overhead
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns with private helper functions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes with descriptive messages
- **Bitcoin Native**: Built on Stacks for direct Bitcoin security and finality

### 🔐 Security Features
1. **Reentrancy Protection**: Built-in through Clarity's execution model
2. **Overflow/Underflow Protection**: Automatic via Clarity runtime
3. **Access Control**: Role-based permissions (owner, creator, participants)
4. **Input Validation**: All parameters validated before execution
5. **Trust Score System**: Anti-fraud mechanism with penalties
6. **Emergency Controls**: Owner can pause malicious plans

### 💰 Bitcoin Alignment
- **sBTC Ready**: Designed to accept sBTC once deployed
- **Block Height Tracking**: Uses `burn-block-height` for Bitcoin finality
- **Post-Conditions**: Can enforce Bitcoin-backed guarantees
- **Native Bitcoin Security**: Inherits Bitcoin's security model

## Trust Score System

### Initial Score
- All users start with a trust score of **50**

### Score Increases (+1 per action)
- ✅ Complete a cycle contribution on time
- ✅ Successfully receive payout
- 🔼 Max score: 100

### Score Decreases (penalties)
- ❌ Miss a contribution deadline: -5
- ❌ Leave plan early: -10
- ❌ Fraudulent activity: -50
- 🔽 Min score: 0

### Score Requirements
- Plans can require minimum trust scores (0-100)
- Prevents known bad actors from joining
- Builds community reputation over time

## Security Considerations

### What We Protect Against

✅ **Reentrancy Attacks**: Clarity's execution model prevents reentrancy
✅ **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Automatic runtime protection
✅ **Unauthorized Access**: Strict permission checks on all mutations
✅ **Invalid State Transitions**: Comprehensive validation on all inputs
✅ **Front-Running**: Bitcoin finality provides ordering guarantees
✅ **Denial of Service**: Gas limits and participant caps

### Audit Checklist

- [x] All public functions have access control
- [x] All inputs validated before processing
- [x] All STX transfers use checked arithmetic
- [x] All maps have proper key uniqueness
- [x] All errors have descriptive codes
- [x] No unchecked external calls
- [x] Emergency pause functionality
- [x] Clear upgrade path defined

## Gas Optimization

### Efficient Design Choices
1. **Minimal Storage**: Only essential data stored on-chain
2. **Batch Operations**: Can approve multiple requests
3. **Indexed Lookups**: O(1) access to all core data
4. **List Optimization**: Using bounded lists (max 100 participants, 50 requests)
5. **No Loops**: All operations constant time

### Estimated Gas Costs
- Create Plan: ~5,000 - 8,000 gas
- Join Request: ~2,000 - 3,000 gas
- Approve Request: ~3,000 - 4,000 gas
- Contribute: ~4,000 - 6,000 gas

## Bitcoin Integration

### Current Implementation
- Uses `burn-block-height` for Bitcoin block tracking
- Each action timestamped to Bitcoin blocks
- Inherits Bitcoin's consensus and finality

### Future sBTC Integration
When sBTC is deployed, the contract can be upgraded to:

```clarity
;; Accept sBTC deposits
(define-public (contribute-sbtc (plan-id uint) (amount uint))
  (begin
    ;; Transfer sBTC instead of STX
    (try! (contract-call? .sbtc-token transfer 
           amount tx-sender (as-contract tx-sender) none))
    ;; Rest of contribution logic...
  )
)
```

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Clarinet CLI installed
2. Stacks testnet account with STX
3. Node.js for testing

### Steps

1. **Test Locally**
```bash
cd voxcard-stacks
clarinet test
clarinet console
```

2. **Deploy to Testnet**
```bash
clarinet deployments generate --testnet
clarinet deployments apply -p testnet
```

3. **Verify Deployment**
```bash
# Check contract on explorer
open "https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/[TX_ID]?chain=testnet"
```

4. **Update Frontend**
```bash
cd ../frontend
# Update .env
echo "VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=[DEPLOYED_ADDRESS]" >> .env
echo "VITE_CONTRACT_NAME=voxcard-savings" >> .env
```

### Mainnet Deployment (When Ready)
```bash
clarinet deployments generate --mainnet
clarinet deployments apply -p mainnet
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (TypeScript)
```typescript
// tests/voxcard-savings.test.ts
import { Clarinet, Tx, Chain } from "@hirosystems/clarinet-sdk";

describe("VoxCard Savings Contract", () => {
  it("creates a plan successfully", async () => {
    // Test plan creation
  });
  
  it("enforces trust score requirements", async () => {
    // Test trust score validation
  });
  
  it("handles contributions correctly", async () => {
    // Test contribution flow
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
- Test with real wallet connections
- Test with multiple simultaneous users
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Load testing for gas optimization

## Maintenance & Upgrades

### Upgrade Strategy
Clarity contracts are immutable, so upgrades require:

1. Deploy new contract version
2. Migrate data (if needed)
3. Update frontend to new contract address
4. Maintain old contract for historical data

### Monitoring
- Track failed transactions
- Monitor trust score distribution
- Analyze gas usage patterns
- Watch for unusual activity
