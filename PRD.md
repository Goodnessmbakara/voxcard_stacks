# VoxCard - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** October 7, 2025  
**Project Status:** Pre-Launch / Validation Phase

---

## Executive Summary

**VoxCard** is a decentralized community savings platform (also known as Ajo, Esusu, or ROSCA - Rotating Savings and Credit Association) built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. The platform enables groups of people to pool funds together and receive payouts in a rotating manner, eliminating the need for traditional financial intermediaries while providing transparency, security, and flexibility through Bitcoin-backed blockchain technology.

### Vision Statement
To democratize access to community-based savings by providing a transparent, secure, and blockchain-powered alternative to traditional rotating savings circles, making financial cooperation accessible to everyone regardless of geographic location or banking infrastructure.

### Core Value Proposition
- **Transparency:** All transactions, contributions, and payouts are recorded on-chain and publicly verifiable
- **Security:** Smart contracts eliminate escrow risk and middleman fraud
- **Flexibility:** Support for partial payments, various contribution frequencies, and customizable group parameters
- **Trust:** On-chain reputation system (trust scores) incentivizes good behavior and reliable participation
- **Accessibility:** Gasless transaction support reduces barriers to entry

---

## Problem Statement

### Primary Problem
Traditional rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs/Ajo/Esusu) face several critical issues:

1. **Trust & Fraud Risk:** Participants must trust a central coordinator who collects and distributes funds, creating opportunities for embezzlement or mismanagement
2. **Lack of Transparency:** Manual record-keeping leads to disputes about contributions and payout schedules
3. **Geographic Limitations:** Traditional circles require physical proximity and face-to-face trust
4. **Inflexibility:** Fixed payment schedules don't accommodate varying financial situations
5. **No Accountability System:** Once someone defaults or disappears, there's no recourse or reputation tracking

### Target Market Pain Points

**For Individual Savers:**
- Difficulty accessing formal banking/credit systems
- High fees and minimum balance requirements at traditional banks
- Lack of saving discipline without community accountability
- Fear of fraud in traditional Ajo circles
- Need for flexible payment options

**For Community Organizers:**
- Time-consuming manual administration
- Risk of being blamed for fund mismanagement
- Difficulty tracking and enforcing contributions
- Challenges in vetting new members

1. User navigates to "Create Group" page
2. Fills out form with plan parameters
3. Clicks "Create Plan" button
4. Wallet popup for transaction signature
5. Transaction confirmation
6. Redirect to plan detail page

**Contract Functions:**
- `ExecuteMsg::CreatePlan` - Creates new plan
- `QueryMsg::GetPlansByCreator` - Retrieves creator's plans

---

### 2. Browse & Join Plans

**User Story:** As a saver, I want to browse available savings plans and request to join one that fits my needs.

**Discovery Flow:**
1. User navigates to "Browse Groups" page
2. Views list of available plans (paginated)
3. Filters by:
   - Contribution amount
   - Frequency
   - Trust score requirement
   - Number of participants
4. Clicks on a plan to view details
5. Clicks "Request to Join"

**Approval Mechanism:**
- User submits join request to smart contract
- Existing participants vote to approve/deny
- Requires 50%+ approval votes to join
- Approved users are inserted at current payout index position
- Upon approval, trust score increases by +2

**Smart Contract Logic:**
- `RequestToJoinPlan` - Creates join request
- `ApproveJoinRequest` - Existing member approves
- `DenyJoinRequest` - Existing member denies
- Automatic acceptance when threshold reached
- Automatic rejection when denial threshold reached

**Security Checks:**
- User not already participant
- Plan not full
- User's trust score meets minimum requirement
- No duplicate join requests

---

### 3. Contribute to Plan

**User Story:** As a participant, I want to make my regular contribution so that I maintain good standing and receive my payout when it's my turn.

**Contribution Flow:**
1. User navigates to "Dashboard" or plan detail page
2. Views current cycle status:
   - Current personal cycle number
   - Required contribution amount
   - Amount contributed this cycle
   - Remaining amount due
   - Outstanding debt from previous cycles
3. Enters contribution amount (STX)
4. Clicks "Contribute"
5. Wallet popup with transaction details
6. Funds sent to contract with contribution transaction
7. Trust score updated based on payment behavior

**Payment Types:**
- **Full Payment:** Pay entire required amount → +10 trust score
- **Partial Payment:** Pay portion of required (if enabled) → +5 trust score
- **Late Payment:** Pay previous cycle debt → +4 trust score
- **Missed Payment:** No payment in cycle → -15 trust score

**Debt Tracking System:**
- Each participant has personal cycle timeline (starts when they join)
- Unpaid amounts from previous cycles roll into "debt"
- Debt must be cleared before contributions count toward current cycle
- Cannot overpay beyond current cycle requirement + debt

**Auto-Payout Mechanism:**
- After each contribution, contract checks if total balance ≥ one full round payout
- If yes, automatically triggers payout to next participant in rotation
- Payout amount = contribution_amount × total_participants
- Recipient determined by round-robin `payout_index`
- Payout index increments after each distribution
- Plan automatically deactivates after all planned cycles complete

**Smart Contract Functions:**
- `Contribute` - Submit contribution with STX funds
- `GetParticipantCycleStatus` - Query cycle status
- `try_auto_payout` - Internal function for automatic distributions

---

### 4. Trust Score System

**User Story:** As a participant, I want to build my on-chain reputation through reliable contributions so that I can access better groups and receive priority payouts.

**Trust Score Mechanics:**

**Starting Score:** 50 (default for new users)

**Score Increases:**
- Join approval: +2
- Full payment on time: +10
- Partial payment (when allowed): +5
- Late payment (covering previous debt): +4

**Score Decreases:**
- Missed cycle: -15

**Trust Score Benefits:**
- Required minimum score to join certain plans
- Higher score = better reputation
- Future enhancement: Priority payout ordering based on score
- Future enhancement: Access to exclusive high-value groups

**Storage:**
- Stored on-chain per user address
- Query: `GetTrustScore { user: address }`
- Global state: `TRUST_SCORE: Map<&Addr, u64>`

## Technical Specifications

### Smart Contract Validation Rules

**Plan Creation:**
- Name: 3-100 characters
- Description: 10-500 characters
- Total participants: 2-100
- Contribution amount: 0.1-10,000 STX
- Duration: 1-36 months
- Trust score required: 0-100

**Contributions:**
- Must be active participant
- Plan must be active
- Must send sufficient STX funds
- Cannot overpay beyond cycle requirement + debt
- Must pay exact amount if partial payments disabled

**Join Requests:**
- User not already participant
- Plan not full
- No existing join request
- User trust score ≥ plan requirement

### Cycle Calculation
- Each participant has **personal cycle timeline** based on join timestamp
- Cycle number = `(current_time - participant_start_time) / cycle_duration`
- Cycle duration:
  - Daily: 86,400 seconds
  - Weekly: 604,800 seconds (7 days)
  - Monthly: 2,592,000 seconds (30 days)

### Payout Logic
- Triggered automatically after each contribution
- Checks if `plan.balance >= contribution_amount * total_participants`
- If yes, sends payout to `participants[payout_index]`
- Increments `payout_index` (wraps to 0 after last participant)
- Increments global `current_cycle`
- Deactivates plan if `current_cycle >= duration_months * cycles_per_month`
