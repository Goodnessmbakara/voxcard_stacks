# Stacks Migration - Build Complete ✅

## Summary

The VoxCard frontend has been successfully migrated from CosmWasm/Xion to Stacks blockchain and builds without errors.

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Old Dependencies
- ✅ Deleted old `ContractProvider.tsx` that used `@burnt-labs/abstraxion`
- ✅ Cleaned up CosmWasm-specific imports

### 2. Updated Imports Across Frontend
Updated all files to use the new Stacks providers:
- ✅ `CreatePlan.tsx` - now imports from `StacksContractProvider`
- ✅ `Dashboard.tsx` - updated provider imports
- ✅ `PlanDetail.tsx` - updated provider imports
- ✅ `Plans.tsx` - updated provider imports
- ✅ `ContributeModal.tsx` - updated provider imports

### 3. Fixed Contract Integration Issues

#### String Type Correction
- **Issue**: Contract expects `frequency` as `string-ascii` type
- **Fix**: Changed from `stringUtf8CV()` to `stringAsciiCV()` in contract calls

#### Amount Conversion
- **Issue**: Users enter STX amounts, but contract expects microSTX
- **Fix**: Added conversion in `createPlan`: `Math.floor(parseFloat(amount) * 1_000_000)`
- **Note**: 1 STX = 1,000,000 microSTX

### 4. Created Documentation
- ✅ Created `ENV_SETUP.md` with environment variable instructions
- ✅ Documented network configurations for testnet and mainnet

## Contract Functions Verified

The frontend correctly integrates with these Stacks contract functions:
- ✅ `create-plan` - Creates a new savings group
- ✅ `request-to-join-plan` - Requests to join a group
- ✅ `approve-join-request` - Approves join requests
- ✅ `deny-join-request` - Denies join requests
- ✅ `contribute` - Makes contributions to a plan
- ✅ Read-only functions for fetching plan data

## Build Status

```bash
✓ Build completed successfully in 2.69s
✓ No linter errors
✓ No TypeScript errors
```

**Build output:**
- `dist/index.html` - 1.17 kB
- `dist/assets/index-BKwOv71Y.css` - 69.98 kB
- `dist/assets/index-C7VdhOVY.js` - 861.29 kB (gzipped: 273.63 kB)

## Environment Setup Required

Before running the app, create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
VITE_STACKS_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
VITE_CONTRACT_NAME=voxcard-savings
```

**Important**: Update `VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with your actual deployed contract address.

## Stacks Integration Features

### Wallet Support
The app uses `@stacks/connect` which supports:
- Leather Wallet (formerly Hiro Wallet)
- Xverse Wallet
- Other Stacks-compatible wallets

### Network Configuration
- **Testnet**: `https://api.testnet.hiro.so`
- **Mainnet**: `https://api.mainnet.hiro.so`
- **Explorer**: `https://explorer.hiro.so/`

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Contract**: Deploy your Clarity contract to Stacks testnet
2. **Update ENV**: Set the deployed contract address in `.env`
3. **Test Wallet Connection**: Connect a Stacks wallet (Leather/Xverse)
4. **Test Contract Calls**: Try creating a plan and contributing
5. **Monitor Transactions**: Check transactions on Hiro Explorer

## Important Notes

### Amount Handling
- **Create Plan Form**: Users enter amounts in STX (e.g., "10")
- **Contract**: Receives amounts in microSTX (e.g., 10,000,000)
- **Contribute Modal**: Currently uses microSTX directly (may need UX improvement)

### UX Consideration
The contribute modal asks users to enter microSTX directly. You may want to update this to accept STX and convert internally for better UX consistency.

### Post Conditions
Currently using `PostConditionMode.Allow` for all transactions. For production, consider adding specific post conditions for better security.
