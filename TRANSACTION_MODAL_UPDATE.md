## 📊 Transaction Flow

### Before Implementation:
```
User Action → Transaction Broadcast → Toast Notification → Navigate Away
                                      ❌ No TX ID visible
                                      ❌ Must check console logs
                                      ❌ No easy verification
```

### After Implementation:
```
User Action → Transaction Broadcast → Success Modal
                                      ✅ TX ID displayed
                                      ✅ Copy button
                                      ✅ Explorer link
                                      ✅ Easy verification
                                      → User closes modal → Navigate
```
